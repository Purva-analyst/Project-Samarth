# 🌾 Project Samarth – Intelligent Q&A System on Indian Government Data

## 🚀 Vision
Government portals like [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/) host thousands of valuable datasets released by different ministries — but they exist in inconsistent formats, making it difficult for policymakers to draw cross-domain insights.  

**Project Samarth** solves this by providing an **AI-powered Question–Answering System** that connects agricultural and climate datasets, enabling users to ask natural-language questions and get data-backed answers with citations.
